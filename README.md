# Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce 📊

## Deskripsi 📝
Customer segmentation is essential in e-commerce to improve marketing strategies. This project applies data analysis techniques to group customers based on their purchasing patterns.

We applied clustering techniques in **Jupyter Notebook** to identify three distinct customer segments:

- **High-value customers** 💎: Frequent, high-volume buyers.
- **Regular customers** 🛍️: Consistent shoppers with moderate frequency.
- **Low-value customers** 🚶‍♂️: Infrequent, low-transaction buyers.

Understanding these customer segments allows e-commerce businesses to develop targeted strategies such as:
- **Loyalty programs** 💖 for high-value customers.
- **Targeted promotions** 🎯 for regular customers.
- **Retention strategies** 🔄 for low-value customers.

## Technology Used ⚙️
- **Python** 🐍: Main programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓: Platform for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** 🧠: For machine learning algorithms (Clustering).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** 📊: For data visualization.
